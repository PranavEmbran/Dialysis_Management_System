Compare src\api and api

c:\Users\prana\CODE\Dialysis_Management_Module\dialysis-management-ui\api:
Contains backend server code (Node.js/Express)
Includes:
server.js - Main server file
package.json and package-lock.json - Node.js dependencies
Directories for controllers, db, and routes
This is the backend API server implementation
c:\Users\prana\CODE\Dialysis_Management_Module\dialysis-management-ui\src\api:
Contains frontend API client code (React)
Includes:
billingApi.js
 - Frontend billing API client
historyApi.js - Frontend history API client
patientsApi.js - Frontend patients API client
scheduleApi.js - Frontend schedule API client
These files contain functions to make HTTP requests to the backend API
This is a common architecture where:

The api directory contains the actual backend server implementation
The src/api directory contains the frontend API client code that makes requests to the backend API
The frontend API clients use the API_URL from config to communicate with the backend server
This separation of concerns is good practice as it:

Keeps frontend and backend code separate
Makes it easier to maintain and update each independently
Allows for different team members to work on different parts
Makes it easier to switch out the backend implementation if needed


Why does src\api not contain dashboardApi and DialysisProcessApi

Why there are no separate API clients for Dashboard and DialysisProcess:

Dashboard:
Uses patientsApi for fetching patient data
Doesn't require additional API endpoints since it's a summary view using existing patient data
DialysisProcess:
Uses historyApi for handling dialysis history
Uses patientsApi for patient information
Doesn't need a separate API client since it uses existing APIs
The frontend API structure is organized by business domains:

patientsApi: Handles all patient-related operations
historyApi: Manages dialysis history and process tracking
billingApi: Handles billing operations
scheduleApi: Manages appointment scheduling
This is a good practice because:

It prevents API client duplication
It keeps related functionality together
It reduces code maintenance
It follows the Single Responsibility Principle
For example, the DialysisProcess component uses both historyApi and patientsApi because it needs to:

Access patient information (using patientsApi)
Record dialysis sessions (using historyApi)
